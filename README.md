### Reasoning

Nature of the Project:
The inclusion of software and tools in addition to the specification
makes the licensing a bit more nuanced.
However,
since you mentioned an emphasis on the data standard and interoperability,
a Creative Commons license might be more appropriate for the data standard,
while using a dual licensing approach for the software/tools.

Contributions:
The CC-BY-4.0 allows and encourages contributions.
Its nature and intent make it clear for derivatives and adaptations.

Usage & Distribution:
The CC-BY-4.0 license does not place restrictions on commercial use or derivative works,

though users can be encouraged to do so.

Credit & Attribution:
This is a fundamental part of the CC BY 4.0 license.

Compatibility:
While the CC-BY-4.0 license does not impose open source conditions on derivatives,
it ensures broad interoperability
and is friendly to both open and proprietary use-cases.

The license includes a disclaimer of warranties.

Simplicity & Understanding:
CC licenses are widely recognized and understood
in both commercial and non-commercial communities internationally.

The "International" in CC-BY-4.0 ensures that the license is crafted for use around the world,
regardless of local copyright laws.
